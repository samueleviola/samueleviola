## About Me

* ** Education:** Master's Degree in Data Science (University of Trento) with a foundation with a Bachelor Degree in Cognitive Science .
* ** Current Role (AI & Vision):** I am involved in Data Analytics and AI implementations in Sport Technology. My work focuses on:
    * Defining **validation protocols and tools** for analyzing and improving **AI models** for event **detection and segmentation**.
    * Translating complex dynamics into **computational heuristics** for data validation.
    * Improving data quality through analysis, error identification, and implementing **corrections in Python**[cite: 18].
* ** Analytical Edge:** My background in Cognitive Psychology provides a unique perspective on data structure and logical reasoning, crucial for developing robust and **Explainable AI** systems.
